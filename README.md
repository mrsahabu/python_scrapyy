# python_scrapyy

My working env is Ubunut 18.0.4

url.txt has URL which Scrapper is going to scrap. It can only scrapp Company Name, Job Title, and Location.

To get job title there is a file (titles_combined.txt) and it contains almost 77k jobs. Install package find_title_job from here 
https://pypi.org/project/find-job-titles//

To get location from text, used python GeoText package. Install package from here https://geotext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html.

To run the script add all files in your root directory  "python htmlparser.py"
